/**
 * This is a demo program showing the use of the DifferentialDrive class, specifically it contains
 * the code necessary to operate a robot with tank drive.
 * adaptations made and used for the 2024 "Crecendo" competition in Belleville and Livonia
 * At the end there was these capabilities:
 * Driving: fast and slow modes, also options for brake and coast drive
 * Climbing: on chain (stage) with dual climbers
 * Intake-lift: up until limit switch hit and reposition on limit switch if bounces off, driver can stop intake
 *   part way for scoring in Amp
 * Intake: in and out, driver can eject at 50% speed for scoring in Amp
 * Shoot: shooting wheel runs for approx 1 second, then intake, load and feed activate at same time.
 * Autons:
 *   Disabled: does nothing
 *   Auton one: not renamed from default. will cross the line
 *   Auton two: will wait 5 seconds and then cross the line
 * 
 * Robot simulation environment saved on github as it's own repository
 * 
 * Intention of baseline, competition and experimental code sections was to quikly change between different but working code
 *   on the fly. This feature was never used and only continued development on "experimental" after very early code point was
 *   saved to baseline
